## 🧩 Why Pattern-Based Learning?

Instead of solving problems randomly, this repository promotes **structured pattern recognition**, enabling faster problem-solving during coding interviews. Once you grasp a pattern, you can tackle multiple problems that share the same underlying logic — saving immense preparation time.

---

## 💡 Tips for Learners

* Try solving each problem **without looking at the solution first**.
* Revisit problems after a few days to **reinforce retention**.
* Focus on **why** a particular pattern fits — not just how the code works.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This repository aims to serve as a **complete roadmap** for DSA and coding interview preparation, arranged thoughtfully from **basics to mastery**. Whether you’re revising for interviews or building a solid DSA foundation, this structured pattern-based approach will accelerate your growth.
